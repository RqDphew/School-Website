                    <p>The beginnings of the teaching-educational process in the school date back to 1958, based on
                        на
                        the decision made on 7-X-1957 to establish an industrial school with a practical
                        training in Bitola, with the task of preparing skilled workers for the needs of
                        industry
                        through two professions - mechanical and electrical with a duration of three years and a capacity of 300
                        students.
                        As the needs for professional staff in the Bitola economy grew, the establishment of
                        Technical School which started working in 1960, and soon after Technical School for
                        adults and the school for highly skilled workers (master school). This school is
                        formed according to the need and request of the then factory for refrigerators Bitola. As further
                        grew up
                        the needs of the economy, so the school expanded and developed. In 1961 in
                        within
                        the school is established and a higher technical school. It later stands out as special
                        educational
                        institution, Technical Faculty, within the University "St. Kliment Ohridski" from Bitola.

                    <br>
                    <p>The development of industry in Bitola required new staff who were not trained in any high school in Bitola. Therefore, in the school year 1967/68, the expansion of the structural types of education in the school began and a department for low current was formed for qualified mechanics for radio-television and electroacoustics.

                        Also based on the growing needs of professionals in the textile industry in
                         Bitola, a textile school was opened within the Center.

                            The needs for professional staff for the economy have necessitated the need for training of
                            expert
                            teaching staff. That is why, within the school, an emergency center is being established
                            studying at the Higher Vocational Pedagogical School from Rijeka-Republic of Croatia. The gradual
                            formation of the mentioned schools, schools and centers and their concentration in the building of
                            the industrial school was a prerequisite for the establishment of a new educational institution of
                            professional staff, electro-mechanical school center.
